AI assistant for medical coding

Submission for 2023 lablab.ai TruEra & Google Vertex AI hackathon

## About
Using TruLens and Google Vertex AI we have created a RAG chatbot for medical coding professionals to use for assisting with medical coding of medical services. Using the latest CMS ICD and CPT codes, the assistant can analyse, lookup and send the proper codes.

TruLens is used to test the conciseness of the LLM when compared to the med coder question asked along with checking if any personal information was passed. We are assuring the AI will not get any personal health information and just focus on the medical services.
